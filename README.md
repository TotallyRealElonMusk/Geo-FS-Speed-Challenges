Geo-FS Speed Challenges is an addon for Geo-FS for parkour challenges. Similar to the ones present in the Top Gun DLC of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, the player must pass through waypoints as fast as possible, and as low as possible, in the fastest time. They will get a score at the end based on these three variables. 

# **How to use this addon:**

This addon is very easy to use! 
First, you must click on the addon's button on the bottom tab to get the addon's in-game page. You can choose the parkour from the drop-down list. Then, click on the "Load JSON" button to load the parkour into your system. The next two buttons are "Start challenge" and "Reload challenge". The latter resets everything to zero. "Start challenge" makes the player spawn at the designated position to start the parkour, as well as turn on the looping mechanism. It will also open the Nav tab with the flight path of the parkour pre-entered. 
Timers will start when the player reaches the first waypoint.
